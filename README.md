# Stock Price Range Forecaster (GRU vs LSTM)

Stock market forecasting plays a vital role in helping investors and analysts make informed decisions. In this project, we focus on predicting the **next-day highâ€“low price range** of a stock using deep learning sequence models. We compare **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** architectures to determine which model better captures time series patterns in stock price data.

Our pipeline ensures fair comparison by using the same preprocessing, feature set, and evaluation metrics for both models.  
Developed as part of the **AI4ALL Summer Program**.
